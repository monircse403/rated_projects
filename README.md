1. First I install fresh laravel project.
2. I made the migrations and faker to load dummy data
3. I made the api to get the calls of all data
4. For reporting I am not complete as I am feeling sick tomorrow I will start works on that.
5. It takes only 1:30hrs for me to do this task.


If you need any idea or give me suggestion please let me know
